Once I know enough, i might attempt to do it from scratch as i would have a roadmap for guidance and troubleshooting.

It supports:
1. Simple Mesh Generation - can create and save 3D shapes along with Boiler Plate UV Maps generated by any 3D engine. Saved as .asset file.
2. Mesh Renderer - temporarily uses the .NET's renderer to view the Object
3. Project and Asset Management - Create new or Open old projects, Update the Asset Paramenters and Save it back for changes later.
4. File Manager

Implemented:
1. DirectX 12 Renderer
2. Shaders Compilation

Currently working on:
1. Implementation of Renderer in main view

Later:
1. Import Assets

# As of learning process, I won't be uploading the code. But it may hold my logs and a finished release/debug build.
